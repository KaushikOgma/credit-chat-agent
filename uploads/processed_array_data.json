These accounts were closed on February 1, 2018, and reported to the credit bureau on March 31, 2018. Additionally, there are two educational installment loans from Edfinancial, both of which were charged off on September 30, 2017, with unpaid balances of $0, indicating that they have been written off. These loans had high balances of $3,500 and $3,467, respectively, and were reported with a late payment history, including multiple instances of being late over 120 days. The credit comments indicate that the loans were placed for collection and that they were permanently assigned to the government. All accounts are categorized under collection services or banking, and they reflect a significant negative impact on the borrower's credit profile due to the charge-offs and collections.",

However, it is impacted by several factors including the recency of the oldest account, the presence of multiple installment accounts with delinquent statuses, and a lack of sufficient real estate account information. Additionally, inquiries have negatively affected the score. The second score, SCORE002, is significantly lower at 553, indicating poor credit health. This score is adversely affected by a bankruptcy on the credit report, the absence of open bankcard or revolving accounts, insufficient credit history, and the recency of the oldest account.
